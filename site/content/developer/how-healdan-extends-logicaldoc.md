title: How Healdan Extends LogicalDOC
weight: 5
---

Healdan is a fork of [LogicalDOC Community Edition](https://github.com/logicaldoc/community) 9.3.1. It goes its own
way, but still merges upstream's fixes, so its own work stays out of upstream's files wherever it can.

## LogicalDOC's Modules

- `logicaldoc-util` is at the bottom, and `logicaldoc-core` builds on it.
- The feature modules build on core: `logicaldoc-webservice` (SOAP through CXF, and REST), `logicaldoc-webdav`,
  `logicaldoc-cmis`, `logicaldoc-dropbox`, `logicaldoc-android` and `logicaldoc-ios`.
- `logicaldoc-webapp` is the WAR that bundles everything. `logicaldoc-gui` is the GWT client, and depends only on
  util. `logicaldoc-i18n` holds the message bundles.

## Plugins

Almost every module is a JPF plugin, and a plugin takes four pieces:

1. `src/main/resources/plugin.xml` declares its id, what it needs, and the extensions it adds.
2. A class extending `com.logicaldoc.util.plugin.LogicalDOCPlugin` can register servlets, scheduled tasks and
   loggers when the plugin installs.
3. `src/main/assembly/assemblyplugin.xml` packages a `*-plugin.zip`.
4. An `artifactItem` in `logicaldoc-webapp/pom.xml` copies the zip into the WAR. Without it, the plugin isn't
   shipped.

Core's `plugin.xml` defines the extension points other plugins hook into, such as `DbInit`, `DocumentListener`,
`FolderListener`, `Task`, `Feature` and `SystemInfo`. `logicaldoc-dropbox` is the smallest complete plugin to
learn from.

## Spring and Hibernate

- `web.xml` starts `com.logicaldoc.util.spring.MainContext`. It scans `com.logicaldoc` for `@PluginContext`
  classes and imports the webapp's `context.xml`, which defines the datasource, the session factory and
  transactions.
- Entities are JPA-annotated `@Entity` classes. DAOs follow one pattern: an interface `XxxDAO` and an
  implementation `HibernateXxxDAO`.
- **Both Spring and Hibernate scan only `com.logicaldoc`,** so code in any other package isn't found.

## Healdan's Code

- **`healdan-core`** is Healdan's plugin. It holds Healdan's server rules and all its data, under
  `com.logicaldoc.healdan`, where the scans find it with no edits.
  - Its GUI code is in `logicaldoc-gui`, under `com.logicaldoc.gui.frontend.client.healdan`, reached from one-line
    hooks in upstream's GUI classes.
  - Its servlets register with `@WebServlet`. Its RPC paths are `/frontend/healdan*` and its data paths
    `/data/healdan*`.
  - Its listeners enforce Healdan's rules on every route into the server: the web UI, the API, WebDAV and CMIS.
- **Its own tables.** Flyway owns the tables whose names start `hd_`, and only those. A change ships as a new
  script under `healdan-core/src/main/resources/healdan/db/migration/`, never as an edit to one that has shipped.
  Healdan never changes the structure of LogicalDOC's `ld_` tables.
- **One-time setup steps** in `com.logicaldoc.healdan.seed` create what Healdan needs inside LogicalDOC, such as
  the Everyone group and the Healdan profile. Each records that it ran in `hd_setting`, and never runs again, so a
  new default ships as a new step.
- **`HealdanHooks`** in `logicaldoc-core` lets the few places in LogicalDOC that write without telling its
  listeners ask Healdan first. Every refusal throws `HealdanVetoException`, which the document and folder DAOs roll
  back on.
- **Upstream edits** are kept small, and each milestone's design spec lists every upstream file it edits, with the
  reason.
