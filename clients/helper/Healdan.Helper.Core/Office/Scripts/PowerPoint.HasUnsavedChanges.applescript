--   1. its exact path, in either spelling (pTwin is the same path with /private added or taken off);
--   2. its file name, but only for a presentation that is in the Copies folder (copiesFolder or copiesTwin), so a
--      presentation with the same name anywhere else is never taken for it;
--   3. the add-in's mark;
--   4. its window's name;
